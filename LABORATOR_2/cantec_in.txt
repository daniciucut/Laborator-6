[Verse 1]
In the still of the night, I hear you calling
Whispers in the wind, gently falling
Lost in memories, of days gone by
I close my eyes, and let out a sigh

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me
In this moment of eternity
We'll dance beneath the stars above
And cherish this feeling of love

[Verse 2]
Through the highs and lows, we'll find our way
Together we'll conquer, come what may
Hand in hand, we'll face the storm
Knowing that our love will keep us warm

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me
In this moment of eternity
We'll dance beneath the stars above
And cherish this feeling of love

[Bridge]
Though time may pass and seasons change
Our love will always remain the same
In your arms, I've found my home
Forever together, never alone

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me
In this moment of eternity
We'll dance beneath the stars above
And cherish this feeling of love

[Outro]
In the still of the night, I hear you calling
Whispers in the wind, gently falling
